This is the README associated to the malloc project.

First of all, we juste have a basic (first fit) malloc.
Its totally transparent for the user.
Associated Makefile was update to allow it.

Then all the other functions which are used by malloc are implemented.
	Calloc 
	Free
	Realloc

For each one there is a testsuite to test them on real func with our dynmic 
library.
