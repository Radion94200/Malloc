This is the TODO list associated to the malloc subject

First step was to create the struct of the malloc.
Then we need to create the malloc and the associated testsuite.

Then i do the free func to liberate the mem precedently allocated
For the beginning the easier way and then more complicated.

Then must do the calloc func which is use for put all cases at 0.
I must use memset to use it.

Then for the final i'll do realloc.
